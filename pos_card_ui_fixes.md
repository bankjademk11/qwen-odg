# POS Product Card UI Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. Product cards were stretching and not displaying beautifully
2. Cards were not consistent in size when there were fewer products
3. Layout was not visually appealing with varying content lengths

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Card Heights
- Set all product cards to a fixed height of 250px
- Added `min-height` and `max-height` to ensure consistency
- Added `overflow: hidden` to prevent content overflow

### 2. Improved Grid Layout
- Added `grid-auto-rows: 250px` to ensure all rows have the same height
- Added `justify-items: stretch` to ensure cards stretch to fill grid cells
- Increased minimum card width from 140px to 150px for better spacing

### 3. Enhanced Card Styling
- Added consistent border and border-radius to all cards
- Improved image styling with proper border-radius matching the card
- Fixed product name styling with line clamping to prevent overflow

### 4. Content Consistency
- Set fixed heights for all text elements (name, code, price, stock)
- Added proper flexbox properties to prevent shrinking
- Improved line height and text overflow handling

## Technical Details

### Product Grid
```css
.product-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 250px;
  gap: 1rem;
  overflow-y: auto;
  max-height: 75vh;
  align-content: start;
  justify-items: stretch;
}
```

### Product Card
```css
.product-card {
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: transform 0.2s, box-shadow 0.2s;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 250px;
  min-height: 250px;
  max-height: 250px;
  overflow: hidden;
  border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.125);
  border-radius: 0.375rem;
}
```

### Product Name
```css
.product-name {
  font-size: 0.85rem;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 0.25rem;
  height: 40px;
  overflow: hidden;
  flex-shrink: 0;
  line-height: 1.3;
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
}
```

## Results
These changes ensure that:
1. All product cards have consistent dimensions regardless of content
2. The grid layout looks balanced with any number of products
3. Cards don't stretch or look distorted
4. Text content is properly truncated when too long
5. The UI looks professional and visually appealing
